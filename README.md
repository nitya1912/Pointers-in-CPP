# Title:
C++ code for working with pointers and variables.

# Theory:
This C++ code demonstrates the use of pointers. It declares a variable, `var`, and a pointer, `ptr`, which points to the variable. The code then prints the value and memory addresses of both the variable and the pointer.

# Algorithm:
Algorithm includes the following steps: 1)Declare an integer variable var and initialize it with the value 10. 2)Declare an integer pointer ptr and initialize it with the memory address of the var variable. 3)Print the value of var using cout. 4)Print the value that ptr points to (the value of var) using cout. 5)Print the memory address of the var variable using cout.
6)Print the value of the ptr variable (the memory address of var) using cout. 7)Print the memory address of the ptr variable using cout.

# Explanation of Code:
The code declares an integer variable `var` and an integer pointer `ptr` that points to `var`. It then prints the value and memory addresses of `var` and `ptr`.

# Title: 
C++ code for pointers dealing with floating-point numbers.

# Theory:
The provided C++ code showcases the use of pointers with floating-point variables. It declares a floating-point variable, initializes a pointer to reference that variable, and then displays the values and memory addresses of both the variable and the pointer.

# Algorithm:
Algorithm includes: 1)Declare a floating-point variable var and initialize it with the value 10.34. 2)Declare a floating-point pointer ptr. 3)Assign the memory address of var to ptr. 4)Print the value of var. 5)Print the value pointed to by ptr (which is the value of var). 6)Print the memory address of var. 7)Print the memory address of ptr.

# Explanation of Code:
The code declares a floating-point variable, initializes a pointer to reference that variable, and then prints the values and memory addresses of both the variable and the pointer.

# Title:
C++ code using a pointer to iterate through an array of integers and print the values of the array elements. 

# Theory:
The provided C++ code showcases the use of a pointer to iterate through an integer array and print the values of its elements. It initializes a pointer to the first element and increments it in a loop to access and display each array element.

# Algorithm:
Algorithm includes: 1)Declare an integer array var with 5 elements and initialize it with values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. 2)Declare an integer pointer ptr and initialize it with the memory address of the first element of the array, i.e., &var[0]. 3)Enter a for loop that iterates from i=0 to i=4 (for each element of the array). 4)Inside the loop, print the value pointed to by ptr (the current element in the var array) along with an appropriate message. 5)Increment the pointer ptr using ptr++ to make it point to the next element in the array. 6)Repeat steps 4 and 5 for each element in the array. 7)End the algorithm.

# Explanation of Code:
The code prints the values of an integer array using a pointer. It initializes a pointer to the first array element and iterates through the array, incrementing the pointer to access and display each element.
